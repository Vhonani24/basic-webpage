        <h2>My bucket list dream destination: Abu Dhabi</h2>
        <p><img src="./images/abu.jpg" class="abu" />
          I would like to visit Abu Dhabi someday because it is the capital of the United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi is a well-ordered, industrious city with a pretty waterside location. The revenues transformed Abu Dhabi into the modern city of today and it is a  bustling center of government and business. The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is the major tourist attraction and wows all who visit. It is a much calmer, more traditional city and more family and community led city. There's more focus on a good work-life balance in this city.</p>

        <p>
          The reason why I want to learn spanish language is because it will make my travel experiences more exciting and rewarding. There are 21 countries in the world that have Spanish as an official language. Knowing the language will make my travel experiences in beautiful Spain and Latin America much easier. A good grasp of the Spanish language will be a valuable window into helping me learn about the true culture of the areas I visit, which will truly enhance my travel experience.
